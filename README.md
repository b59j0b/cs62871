Assignment 2: Escape Artists 
For this assignment, you will be exploring and evaluating   the   user   interfaces   of two free 3D creation tools: (a) Roblox Studio (desktop version on Windows   PC   or   macOS)   and   (b)   your   choice of only one of the following:
● Rec Room (mobile version on   iOS or Android).
● Rec Room (desktop version on Windows   PC or VR headset; there   is   no   Mac   version).
● Horizon Worlds (requires   Meta. Quest headset).
You will   use   Roblox Studio and the other tool you choose to   design   a   simple   escape   room   experience in   each tool with:
● A confined space with an entrance   and   exit.
● At   least one   puzzle that   must   be solved.
● At   least one   interactive object that   responds to   player input.
●       A clear success   condition   that   allows   the   player to “escape.” Your focus should be on evaluating the user   interfaces   of the   two   tools   rather than   the   quality complexity, or difficulty of the escape room you design.   Since   you   are   being   asked   to   compare   your experience using each tool,   please aim for lots   of similarity   between   your   rooms!   But   you are also welcome to   include functionality that   might be possible   in   only   one   of the tools.
Note that you will not be submitting the rooms you create, only your analysis of the tools. 
You should begin by acquainting yourself with   Roblox Studio   and   the   other tool   you   chose, being sure to   keep track of your first   impressions (ideally by writing   or   recording),   so you   can   include them in your analysis of the   applications.
Important: For the purposes of this assignment, please ignore any paid functionality or premium features. For Roblox, do not use marketplace assets that cost Robux. For Rec Room, do not evaluate features that require Rec Room Plus or token purchases. Use only the free creation tools provided by each platform, and do not upgrade your account, even for a short-term free offer! 
Heuristic Evaluation, User Interface Analysis, and Proposed Improvements 
In addition to an   introduction and conclusions (keep   them   brief), your   evaluation   should   have three sections, each based on your experience   using the applications and their documentation to create your escape room   experiences.
1. Heuristic Evaluation (45 points) 
In the first section, you should address the ten   usability   heuristics   introduced   in class (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), mentioning specific examples of   how well each of the applications does or does   not satisfy   each   heuristic.   Please   do   this   by creating ten subsections, one for each heuristic.   In each   subsection, you   should   discuss   both      applications, being sure to specify the   application to which you   are   referring   and   to   distinguish   the key differences between   the   two   applications. 
2. User Interface Analysis (45 points) 
In the second section,   please cover the four areas listed   below,   taking   into   account   the input methods appropriate to   Roblox Studio (mouse,   keyboard) and your single   chosen   platform.
● Desktop (Rec Room Desktop): Mouse,   keyboard.
● Mobile (Rec Room Mobile): Touchscreen, attitude sensor, accelerometer (if   applicable).
● VR (Rec Room VR, Horizon Worlds): Head tracking,   hand tracking, VR controllers.
In a separate subsection for each of   the following four areas, describe   and   compare   the techniques that allow the user to accomplish their tasks for   both applications.   Explain   where   the   techniques used   in each application work well, where they are   lacking,   and   how they   could   be improved.
1. Camera manipulation. How the user controls camera   position,   orientation,   field   of view,   projection type, and any other camera parameters when   using   each   application.
a.      What   is the range of camera configurations supported   in each   application?
b.       How   intuitive are the camera controls, especially when   switching   between   free movement and object-focused views?   In your discussion,   please be sure to   be clear about whether you are referring to a change in camera position versus a change in camera field of view. Please see this video for a visual explanation of the often misused terms “zooming” versus “dollying,” which you should use properly in your description. Do not accept uncritically any description, even from the tool developer in their user interface or documentation, of what an application is doing. You   might also want to check out this video for some   classic   examples   of the unsettling ways   in which dollying and zooming   can   be   combined.
2. Object creation, selection, and deletion. How the   user adds   new objects   to   their   scene, selects or deselects objects, and removes objects   from   the   scene.
a. What constraints apply when placing objects?   For example, are   some   objects   restricted to certain surfaces? Can objects   intersect each   other?
b. Is multi-selection for group operations possible? For example,   can   multiple   objects be selected to   be transformed as   a   group?
c. What snapping behaviors are used? Are objects aligned to a   grid?   Does   the   system allow free   placement?
3. Object manipulation and control of properties. How   the   user   manipulates   objects   (translation,   rotation, scaling), and modifies object properties   such   as   appearance, behavior, and   interactivity.
a. What input methods exist for manipulating objects? For example,   manual   entry of coordinates, gizmo handles, and freehand gestures.
b.       Pay special attention to how each   platform   supports   the   creation   of interactive elements necessary for escape-room mechanics (e.g.,   puzzles, triggers,   and conditional events). To what degree do the tools   have   useful elements   built   in   and   easy to   import and   use?
c.       Although you are not required to deeply explore   scripting   in   any tool,   you   代 写COMS W4172: 3D User Interfaces and Augmented Reality Assignment 2—Spring 2025SPSS
代做程序编程语言should note what scripting and drag-and-drop logic capabilities are available, along with any premade assets, and use those that   are   necessary to   provide   the requested simple escape-room features listed at   the   beginning   of the assignment.   How usable do   you think these capabilities   are for   non-programmers? 
4. Testing and player experience. 
a.       How can the creator test their escape   room   by   acting   as   a player?
b.       How easy   is   it to switch   between editing and testing?
c.       Does the system allow for live editing,   or   must   the   user   restart   each   time?
d.       If the tools you are comparing are for different platforms (e.g.,   Roblox   Studio   on   PC and   Horizon Worlds on Quest),   how does the user   experience   differ   because      of platform. differences?
In considering these   issues,   please address any of the ten usability   heuristics   that   you feel   are   particularly   relevant.   However, you are   not   limited to these   heuristics, and should   mention anything you think   is   important that the   heuristics do   not cover. (If you are   familiar with   any   other   applications that support similar functionality, you are welcome, but not required, to optionally draw comparisons to them.)
3. Proposed Improvements (10 points) 
In the third section,   please propose two suggestions per tool (four total)   for   improvements   to   its   implementation of any of the areas covered in   Section   2.
Please explain why you believe that your suggested improvements   to   each   tool will   be   beneficial   to the user's overall experience and   how each tool   currently   fails   to   meet   the   needs   that   your suggested improvements address. Your suggestions can be taken   and   expanded   from   your analysis   in the previous sections.
Guidance 
Note that this   is a written analysis/essay assignment, with no   code   or   apps to   submit.   Please   think critically and provide thoughtful, well-developed descriptions, explanations,   and comparisons. There   is   no   required   minimum word count, and you are   not being   asked   to write   documentation, although you should refer to existing official   (not third-party)   documentation when relevant without simply repeating it.   Instead, you are being asked to evaluate the usability of the systems. Therefore, you will need to make assertions about the   artifacts   you   are evaluating and to defend the assertions you   make by   citing   the   heuristics   or   other   criteria addressed   in the books or in class and   explaining   how   the   two   applications   follow   or violate   them. Please   include relevant screenshots in your evaluation,   integrate them   into your   document,   and   refer to them.   If you choose   Horizon Worlds,   please include clear screenshots that demonstrate   the creation   interface.
There are   no limits on the length   of your assignment.   However,   based   on   our   experience,   a complete assignment will   include around one or two paragraphs   per   heuristic   (although some may   be   longer) for Section   1,   longer discussions for each area   in Section 2,   and   up   to   two pages for Section 3,   usually totaling   no less than ten   pages overall.   Our   grading   will   be   based on   how well you explain and justify your comparisons and arguments. Be concise and   clear.   We will   not   reward you for writing a lot, for repeating yourself, or for   including   overly   large pictures. You will   not get   points “just for writing something.” Please talk to   us   if you   have any   questions about this. 
Your choice of platform. should be clearly stated at the beginning of your report. 
Hints 
Imagine that you were about to interview for one of the teams whose   applications   you   are analyzing, or perhaps another company interested   in creating   a   competing   application. As you do this assignment, try to display your understanding of the two user interfaces and the tradeoffs between them in a way that would inspire confidence in a savvy technical interviewer (i.e., not the person from human resources). 
Please   note that these applications require   installation and may   be   resource-intensive.   Please   make sure that you do   not   leave the assignment for the   last   minute—we will   not   be offering additional late days/hours to compensate for installation difficulties   or   other   technical   issues.
This is an individual assignment, so please treat   it   that way, including your initial exploration of each application.   In alignment with our CS Department Academic Honesty Policy, using large language   models, such as ChatGPT, or any other chatbots   or   resources   that   provide   solutions,   such as Chegg,   is not allowed. Any form. of academic   dishonesty will   be   registered   with   the Academic Committee and reported to the appropriate   dean(s).
What to Submit 
You should submit your written evaluation as a   PDF file.   Note again   that   screen   captures   should   be   integrated   into your document, and   not   included as separate   images.   Please   be sure that your name and uni appear at   the   beginning   of the   submission.
How to Submit 
Your assignment should consist of a single PDF file submitted through   CourseWorks   in   response to Assignment 2.
Immediately after uploading your submission, please check it by downloading it to make sure that it was the correct file. We will not accept excuses that you accidentally uploaded the wrong file. 
Please try to submit well before the deadline, since   CourseWorks   can   sometimes   become   busy   and slow. You   may use any   number of your remaining   late days   on   this   assignment,   though remember that there   is one   more assignment   left on which   you can   use   late days.   Please   start   early!
